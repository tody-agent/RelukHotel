CapyInn is a desktop app for mini hotels and guesthouses that need a local-first operating tool without relying on a remote backend. The project focuses on real front-desk workflows: room layout setup, faster guest intake, Vietnamese ID OCR, nightly pricing, housekeeping, revenue reporting, and end-of-day reconciliation.

> Note: `CapyInn` is a clean-slate rename from `MHM`. Current builds use the new runtime root at `~/CapyInn` and do not auto-migrate legacy local data from `~/MHM`.

## What CapyInn solves

CapyInn is built for a narrow but practical use case: small hotels that need a system they can run locally, control directly, and adopt without a long setup project.

| Before | With CapyInn |
| --- | --- |
| Handwritten logs and fragmented tracking | Room status, bookings, and transactions live in one app |
| Manual guest registration entry | OCR extracts Vietnamese ID details and speeds up intake |
| Nightly pricing calculated by hand | Check-in, extend-stay, check-out, and folio flows are automated |
| End-of-day reporting done manually | Dashboard, analytics, expenses, and night audit are built in |
| Initial setup takes too much time | Onboarding generates room types, layouts, and operating defaults |

## Product demo

## Key features

### Onboarding and property setup

- Configure hotel identity, check-in and check-out rules, invoice details, and app lock
- Create room types and default pricing during the first-run wizard
- Generate a room layout by floors, room count, and naming scheme

### Front-desk operations

- Dashboard organized around the configured room layout
- Check-in, check-out, extend-stay, and reservation flows in one desktop app
- Support for multiple guests on the same booking
- Fast copy flow for guest registration details

### Vietnamese ID OCR

- Local OCR powered by PaddleOCR v5 through `ocr-rs`
- Watches `~/CapyInn/Scans/` for new scan files
- Extracts guest name, national ID number, birth date, and address for check-in

### Billing, payments, and reporting

- Night-based pricing by room type
- Charge, payment, deposit, and balance tracking
- Revenue analytics, expense tracking, and CSV export

### Housekeeping and night audit

- Post-checkout housekeeping state tracking
- Maintenance notes per room
- Night-audit flow for daily reconciliation

### Pricing

- Multi-mode pricing engine: hourly, overnight, daily, and monthly rate plans
- Step-function hourly pricing with automatic fallback to daily rates
- Dynamic pricing rules: weekend surcharges, holiday rates, specific-date overrides
- Early check-in and late check-out surcharge with configurable step thresholds
- Extra bed charging based on occupant count vs room capacity
- Price override ("Linh động giá") per stay without affecting base rate plan
- Real-time pricing preview during check-in and check-out

### MCP and automation integrations

- CapyInn can be extended through MCP-friendly workflows for operator tooling and agent-driven automations
- These flows can be paired with OpenClaw and n8n for custom orchestration around hotel operations
- For Zalo personal chat automations, you can use the prebuilt community node [`n8n-nodes-zca-zalo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-zca-zalo), published on npm and built on top of `zca-js`

### Crash reporting

- Severe crashes are always written locally under `~/CapyInn/diagnostics` so the app can recover on the next launch.
- Sending a sanitized crash report to Sentry is optional and controlled in Settings. The remote report flow does not include usage analytics, session replay, guest records, or raw OCR payloads.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| App shell | Tauri 2 |
| Backend | Rust + SQLite (`sqlx`) |
| Frontend | React 19 + TypeScript |
| State | Zustand |
| UI | Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui |
| OCR | `ocr-rs` + PaddleOCR v5 + MNN |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Tests | Vitest + Rust tests + Clippy |

## System requirements

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | 12+ |
| Node.js | 20+ |
| Rust | stable via `rustup` |
| Xcode CLT | recent version |
| Disk footprint | roughly 25MB before operational data |

The project is currently verified most heavily on macOS and Apple Silicon.

## Local development

### Install prerequisites

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
xcode-select --install
node --version
```

### Clone and run the desktop app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chuanman2707/CapyInn.git
cd CapyInn/mhm
npm ci
npm run tauri dev
```

### Build a release bundle

```bash
cd CapyInn/mhm
npm run tauri build
```

Release bundles are generated under `mhm/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Verification

```bash
cd CapyInn/mhm
npm test
npm run build
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

If you only need the web UI during frontend work:

```bash
cd CapyInn/mhm
npm run dev
```

## Known limitations

- OCR is currently optimized for Vietnamese national ID cards; passports and international documents are not complete yet
- Windows and Linux are not first-class targets yet
- The project is designed for mini-hotel scale, not large chain operations
